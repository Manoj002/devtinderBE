- Multiple route handlers - play with code
- next()
- next function and errors along with res.send()
- app.use(route, middleware) => middlewares in array
- what is a middleware, why is it needed
- How express JS handles the flow for request handlers internally
- Difference between app.use and app.all
- Write a dummy auth for admin
- Write a dummy auth for user except login
- error handling using app.use("/", (err, req, res, next) => {})
    - sequence of params for app.use()/app.get()/app.post()... etc.
        - if 2 params are passed => it is considered as request, response
        - if 3 params are passed => it is considered as request, response, next
        - if 4 params are passed => it is considered as error, request, response, next
- error handling using try catch - IMP
